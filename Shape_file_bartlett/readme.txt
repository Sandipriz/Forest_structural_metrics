MELNHE site: Bartett Experimental Forest (BEF)

At BEF, 3 plots per stand were established in 2004 which involved three stands in each of three age classes. The 4th plot in each stand was established in 2005. 
Each of the 9 stands has four treatment plots (50 m x 50 m or 30 m x 30 m), treated annually beginning in spring 2011, with N (30 kg N/ha/yr as NH4NO3), P (10 kg P/ha/yr as NaH2PO4), N+P at the same rates, or neither (an untreated control).
